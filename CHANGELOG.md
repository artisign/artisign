## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-26

First public release of Artisign, as a beta. Everything below is new because
nothing was public before; the version says 0.9 because the tool palette is not
yet under an API-stability promise.

### Added

- The CLI and the daemon on `127.0.0.1`: `init`, `start`, `serve`, `status`,
  `stop`, and a project registry that serves several projects at once.
- The MCP server over stdio and streamable HTTP, exposing the 23-tool palette.
- The file store: augmented HTML per screen, JSON tokens, atomic writes, a
  filesystem watcher, and optional auto-commit per write.
- The design system: tokens, components with variants, patterns, ref drift
  warnings and `promote_to_system`.
- The browser preview: screen list, sandboxed render, live reload over SSE,
  flow mode, comment threads and the design-system view.
- `get_screenshot` and `inspect_node` for the agent's own review loop, backed
  by Playwright as an optional peer dependency.
